                    <h3>Personal growth</h3>
                    <p>One of my first assignments in the course i 1Talent was making a DISC test. A DISC test determines your
                        personal profile. The possible results of the test are the four DISC behavioural styles dominant,
                        influential, stable and conscientious.
                        <br> Making this test was relevant because it allowed me to find out what kind of person I am within
                        a team. I am an influence and a dominant type, which turned out to be the case after the test. On
                        the basis of the results, teams were then formed, wich resulted in groups of different personalities.
                        A situation that occurs frequently in daily life and certainly on the shop floor. Here are some of
                        the works I have done individually or in groups.

                    <p>
                        My most obvious behavioral style is probably Influence, followed by Dominant. When you have Influence and After that dominant
                        as the most important behavioural style, the positive impression you make on people: You are socially
                        minded. You have an intrinsic motivation to make people of very different backgrounds and to maintain
                        these relationships well. You have a natural enthusiasm for all kinds of ideas and developments,
                        both for those of yourself as well as others. You are likely to find people social, convincing and
                        optimistic.
